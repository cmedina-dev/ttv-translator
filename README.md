# TTV Translator

## Description

The translator works by calling Google's API when hovering over a message in order to conserve API calls. Moreover, already seen message digests are stored in a Set with their translations so repeat messages aren't sent to the API.

This project was built using ViolentMonkey. 

Cross-compatibility with other flavors of other "monkey" injectors will be tested in the future.
